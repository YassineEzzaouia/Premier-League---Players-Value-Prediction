# Premier-League---Players-Value-Prediction
This notebook is a data science and machine learning project focused on analyzing and modeling data from the English Premier League.

üìä Main Objectives:

-Import and clean a dataset called epldata_final.csv containing information about Premier League players.

-Explore the dataset (checking missing values, data types, etc.).

-Preprocess the data (likely with pipelines, scalers, and transformers).

-Build regression models using TensorFlow (tf) and scikit-learn.

-Predict numerical targets (such as player value) using machine learning.

‚öôÔ∏è Tools and Libraries Used

-Core libraries: numpy, pandas, matplotlib, geopandas

-ML libraries: scikit-learn, tensorflow

-Techniques:

  Regression modeling

  Cross-validation (KFold)

  Feature scaling (StandardScaler)

  Evaluation metrics like MSE (Mean Squared Error)
